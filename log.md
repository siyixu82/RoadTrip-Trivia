# Build Log — RoadTrip Trivia

A running record of build progress. Newest entries at the top.

Phased plan: Phase 0 scaffold → Phase 1 schema + 3 sample quizzes → Phase 2 play loop → Phase 3 bulk content → Phase 4 catalog/library → Phase 5 auth/offline → Phase 6 polish/ship.

### Recovery note (process)
- A `git reset --hard` was run while scaffold files were staged but **not yet committed**
  (the commit+push command had been blocked as one unit). The reset deleted the staged
  files. All were recreated from the scratchpad scaffold + regenerated; `node_modules`
  survived (gitignored), so no reinstall was needed. **Lesson:** never `reset --hard`
  with un-committed work staged; commit to a branch first.

### Schema finalized before build
- Dropped `history.answers` (no per-question answer storage — confirmed not needed).
- Removed `quizzes.park_name`, `quizzes.state` (MVP-specific) and `quizzes.source` (all quizzes are AI-generated).
- Unified naming: `history.total` → `history.question_count` to match `quizzes.question_count`.
- Synced these changes into CLAUDE.md.

### Phase 0 — Scaffold ✅
- Node v24.15.0, npm 11.12.1.
- Scaffolded **Next.js 16.2.9** (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, ESLint, `src/`, `@/*` alias, Turbopack) via `create-next-app`. React 19.2.4.
  - Note: scaffolded in a temp lowercase dir and copied in, because npm rejects the capitalized `RoadTrip-Trivia` dir name as a package name. `package.json` name is `roadtrip-trivia`.
- Installed `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- **Supabase client** at [src/lib/supabase/client.ts](src/lib/supabase/client.ts) — singleton browser client; throws a clear error if env vars are missing.
- **Typed schema** at [src/lib/supabase/types.ts](src/lib/supabase/types.ts) — hand-authored `Database` type mirroring the four tables (replaceable later via `supabase gen types`).
- **Hello World** home page ([src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)) with a live Supabase connectivity indicator ([src/components/SupabaseStatus.tsx](src/components/SupabaseStatus.tsx)).
- Env: `.env.example` (committed template) + `.env.local` (git-ignored, real Supabase URL + anon key added). `.gitignore` keeps `.env.example` tracked.
- **Supabase connection verified:** anon key authenticates (REST returns PGRST205 "table not found" — expected pre-migration; auth health endpoint 200). URL corrected to base (dropped stray `/rest/v1/`).
- Verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `next build` succeeds, dev server returns HTTP 200.

### Phase 0 — Vercel (in progress)
- Scaffold to be pushed via a feature branch + PR (direct push to `main` is blocked / not the workflow).
- _User action: import repo into Vercel, add the two `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env vars, deploy._

### Next: Phase 1 — Schema migration + 3 sample quizzes (via Supabase CLI)
- Write versioned SQL migration for the four tables + RLS under `supabase/migrations/`.
- Generate 3 sample park quizzes to validate the `questions` jsonb shape end-to-end.
